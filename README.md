# TicTacToe
This is a fully functional mini game of the famous Tic Tac Toe. Using HTML, CSS and Javascript and with the use of the browsers' LocalStorage as a Database, this project makes a minimal digital approach to this 2-player classic game, saves statistics and gives the ability to change player names as well as reset your current score.
